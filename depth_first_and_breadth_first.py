# Breadth-first search (BFS)
# This function performs a breadth-first search on a graph to find the shortest path
# from a start node to a goal node.
# It uses a queue to explore nodes level by level.
# The function returns the path as a list of nodes if found, otherwise None.
# usage :  find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph
# implemented using a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes that have been visited.

# Depth-first search (DFS)
# Depth-first search (DFS) is commonly used to solve puzzles with a single solution, detecting cycles in a graph, and finding connected graph components.
# This function performs a depth-first search on a graph to find a path
# from a start node to a goal node.
# It uses a stack to explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
# The function returns the path as a list of nodes if found, otherwise None.

# Which of the following data structures is commonly used to implement a standard breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm?
# A queue

# Which of the following statements about depth-first search (DFS) is true?
# Depth-first search is typically implemented using recursion or a stack.

# If you wanted to find the shortest path from a starting node to a target node in an unweighted graph, which algorithm would be the most suitable choice?
# Breadth-first search (BFS)
