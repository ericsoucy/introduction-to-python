# In this lab, you'll build a game character stats tracker. The program will allow you to create a character with specific attributes, update those attributes, and retrieve the current stats of the character.
# Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.
# User Stories:

# Create a class named GameCharacter that represents a game character and manages character stats.

# When instantiated, a new GameCharacter object should have the following attributes:

# _name set to the string given at the moment of the instantiation.
# _health set to 100.
# _mana set to 50.
# _level set to 1.
# Create a name property for read-only access to the character's name.

# For the health property:

# Define a getter that returns the current health.
# Define a setter that prevents health from being set below 0, and caps the health at 100.
# For the mana property:

# Define a getter that returns the current mana.
# Define a setter that prevents mana from being set below 0, and caps the mana at 50.
# Create a getter for level to return the character's current level.

# Define a method named level_up that:

# Increases the character's level by 1.
# Resets health to 100 and mana to 50 using their corresponding property setters.
# Prints a message in the form of <name> leveled up to <level>! (where <name> and <level> should be replaced by the character's name and new level, respectively).
# Define a __str__ method that returns a formatted string including:

# The character's name.
# The character's level.
# The character's current health.
# The character's current mana.
